I’m a passionate Web Developer with over nine years of professional experience, working across tech design, planning, implementation, and mentoring newcomers in the industry. I care deeply about clean, well‑structured, and optimized code, always striving to deliver high‑quality solutions that are both scalable and maintainable.

Continuous learning is a core part of who I am. I regularly explore new technologies through personal side projects to stay up to date with modern frameworks and evolving best practices.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on Travelport

Working on a B2B web application based on an internal framework using React, Redux and with a micro-service architecture using Express, GraphQL and a bunch of other tools.
